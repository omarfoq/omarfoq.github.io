I am a second-year PhD student at Inria Sophia-Antipolis (Team <a href="https://team.inria.fr/neo/">NEO</a>). I work on federated learning and distributed optimization under the supervision of <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/">Giovanni Neglia.

My research interests are in machine learning, optimization, and distributed systems. Specific topics include: federated and on-device learning, large-scale machine learning, and distributed optimization.
